#This docker file was generated in order to container this project and allow it to run as an independent service, there are some considerations listed below:
#1. This service is woking with ssl, for run it it in a development environment is necessary  to generate a develop certificate (pfx) and include it in the docker run command.
#2. All the secure ports used must be mapped in the  docker run command.

#Generating the development certificate, example: 
#dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p Arkus@123
#dotnet dev-certs https --trust
#Build the image, example: docker build -f ApiProductsDockerfile -t apiproductsimg .
#Run the container (development environment), example: docker run -it --rm -p 41600:80 -p 44362:443 --name apiproductscnr --network bridge -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=44362 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="Arkus@123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v C:/Users/mind/.aspnet/https:/https apiproductsimg
